### Introduction
The CZ Base and Core implementation guide is based on [FHIR version R4](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/). It defines the minimum rules for interoperability and national customization of FHIR resources, which is applied when creating national profiles for specific use cases. The establishment of standards to support interoperability and their implementation in information systems creates a common basis for the interoperable exchange of health data.

In this implementation guide, you will find the rules for creating national profiles, the use of identifiers and basic information components.

### Scope
This document presents Czech use concepts defined via FHIR processable artefacts; these are collaborative outputs with agreed approaches to varied kinds of healthcare related information based on the core FHIR R4 specification.

This guide is divided into several pages which are listed at the top of each page in the menu bar.
